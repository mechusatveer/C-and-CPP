1) Can we decalre a destructor as pure virtual

There is nothing wrong to declare destructor as virtual or pure virtual
below two example show this.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class A
{
   public:
   virtual ~A()= 0;
};

int main()
{
   return 0;
}

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class A
{
   public:
   virtual ~A()= 0;
};

A::~A()
{
   cout<<"destructor called"<<endl;
}

int main()
{
   return 0;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Can we declare a virtual function as inline
  Can virtual functions be inlined?
  
  By default all the functions defined inside the class are implicitly or 
  automatically considered as inline except virtual functions (Note that inline
  is a request to the compiler and its compilers choice to do inlining or not).
  
  Whenever virtual function is called using base class reference or pointer it 
  cannot be inlined (because call is resolved at runtime), but whenever called 
  using the object (without reference or pointer) of that class, can be inlined 
  because compiler knows the exact class of the object at compile time.
  
  #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base
{
public:
    virtual void who()
    {
        cout << "I am Base\n";
    }
};
class Derived: public Base
{
public:
    void who()
    { 
        cout << "I am Derived\n";
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    // note here virtual function who() is called through
    // object of the class (it will be resolved at compile
    // time) so it can be inlined.
    Base b;
    b.who();
 
    // Here virtual function is called through pointer,
    // so it cannot be inlined
    Base *ptr = new Derived();
    ptr->who();
 
    return 0;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Can virtual function can be private
In C++, virtual functions can be private and can be overridden by the derived class. 
For example, the following program compiles and runs fine.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Derived;
 
class Base {
private:
    virtual void fun() { cout << "Base Fun"; }
friend int main();
};
 
class Derived: public Base {
public:
    void fun() { cout << "Derived Fun"; }
};
 
int main()
{
   Base *ptr = new Derived;
   ptr->fun();
   return 0;
}
Output:

Derived fun()

There are few things to note in the above program.
1) ptr is a pointer of Base type and points to a Derived class object. 
When ptr->fun() is called, fun() of Derived is executed.
2) int main() is a friend of Base.  If we remove this friendship, the program 
wonâ€™t compile (See this).  We get compiler error. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) What is use of pure virtual private
What is the point of a private pure virtual function?

class Engine
{
public:
    void SetState( int var, bool val );
    {   SetStateBool( int var, bool val ); }

    void SetState( int var, int val );
    {   SetStateInt( int var, int val ); }
private:
    virtual void SetStateBool(int var, bool val ) = 0;    
    virtual void SetStateInt(int var, int val ) = 0;    
};

#include <iostream>

class Engine
{
public:
  void SetState( int var, bool val )
  {
    SetStateBool( var, val );
  }

  void SetState( int var, int val )
  {
    SetStateInt( var, val );
  }

private:

    virtual void SetStateBool(int var, bool val ) = 0;
    virtual void SetStateInt(int var, int val ) = 0;

};

class DerivedEngine : public Engine
{
private:
  virtual void SetStateBool(int var, bool val )
  {
    std::cout << "DerivedEngine::SetStateBool() called" << std::endl;
  }

  virtual void SetStateInt(int var, int val )
  {
    std::cout << "DerivedEngine::SetStateInt() called" << std::endl;
  }
};


int main()
{
  DerivedEngine e;
  Engine * be = &e;

  be->SetState(4, true);
  be->SetState(2, 1000);
}

DerivedEngine::SetStateBool() called
DerivedEngine::SetStateInt() called

 I see that a derived class can override its base class private virtual method
 but it cannot use it. So, this is essentially a Template Method pattern

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When should someone use private virtuals?
 
 When you need to make specific behavior in a base class customizable in derived classes,
 while protecting the semantics of the interface
 One case where private virtuals show up is when implementing the Template Method design pattern.
  it as a best practice to always define virtual methods private, unless there is
  a good reason to make them protected
  
   A public virtual method would define both interface and a customization point, 
   a duality that could reflect weak design.
   
   The following code may seem strange at first sight:

class Base
{
private:
   virtual void f() = 0;
};
How can a pure virtual function be private? Will the derived class be able to override it? Actually, 
it's possible for pure virtual functions to have any access modifier: private, protected, or public. 
Moreover, you can also change their access levels when they're overridden in a derived class:

class Derived : public Base
{
public:
   void f()
   {
      std::cout << "Overloaded public f() in Derived class\n";
   }
};
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When to Declare a Virtual Member Function Private

Declaring a virtual member function private may be useful when you wish to limit 
the number of derived classes that can override the given function. In such a case,
you declare all the derived classes, which will be able to override the private virtual 
member function as friends of the base class.

In the following example, only B can override the member function f().
 
class A {
  friend class B;
private:
  virtual int f() { return 1; }
};

class B : public A {
private:
  virtual int f() { return 2; }
};

class C : public A { // will use A::f(), cannot _
override it
};

class D : public B { // will use B::f(), cannot _
override it
};
